    <h1>My 2025 Transfer Results! </h1>
    <p>Here are my 2025 transfer results after 2 years in California Community College (CCC). As of right now, I am clueless in where to go with only 2 schools that I'm leaning towards to. Here are the pros and cons of each school as well as the neccessary stats that goes along with the university with my respective major!</p>

    <h2>Accepted For Transfer For Fall 2025 (Including Major)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>University of California Riverside (CS)</li>
        <li>University of California Santa Cruz (CS)</li>
        <li>University of California Irvine (Software Engineering)</li>
        <li>San Jose State University (Software Engineering)</li>
        <li>Cal Poly Pomona (CS)</li>
        <li>University of California Davis</li>
        <li>University of California Santa Barbara (CS)</li>
        <li>University of California San Diego (CS)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>


    <h2>My thoughs on the list!</h2>
    <p>As of right now, I'm currently debating on two universities for possible transfer. One of them being <strong>San Jose State University</strong> and <strong>UC San Diego</strong>. These two programs stand out among the rest, however, that doesn't mean that other universities are bad. UC Irvine is a great CS and Engineering school so there are still possible changes that I can see myself going to!</p>
